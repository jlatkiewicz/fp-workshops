  //ex. 13 Hard: Write a function that concatenates a list of lists into a single list.
  // Its runtime should be linear in the total length of all lists.
  // Try to use functions we have already defined.

  //ex. 14 Write a function that transforms a list of integers by adding 1 to each element.
  // (Reminder: this should be a pure function that returns a new List!)

  //ex. 15 Write a function that turns each value in a List[Double] into a String.
  // You can use the expression d.toString to convert some d: Double to a String.

  //ex. 20 Write a function that accepts two lists and constructs a new list by adding corresponding elements.
  // For example, List(1,2,3) and List(4,5,6) become List(5,7,9).

  //ex. 21 Generalize the function you just wrote so that itâ€™s not specific to integers or addition. Name your generalized function zipWith.

  //ex. 21 Hard: Implement hasSubsequence for checking whether a List contains another List as a subsequence.
